## NFL Five Factors
[Bill Connelly](https://twitter.com/SBN_BillC) has written several articles explaining the mechanics of his college football win probability model, which he calls [The Five Factors](https://www.footballstudyhall.com/2014/1/24/5337968/college-football-five-factors). I replicate his model using NFL data.
